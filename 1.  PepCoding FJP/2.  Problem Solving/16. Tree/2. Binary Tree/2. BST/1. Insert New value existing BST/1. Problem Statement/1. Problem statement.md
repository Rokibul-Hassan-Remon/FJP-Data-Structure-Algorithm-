### 📄 Problem Statement:

You are given the **root node** of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and an integer value to insert into the tree.

Insert the value into the BST such that the tree remains a valid BST after insertion.  
Return the **root node** of the BST after the insertion.  
It is **guaranteed** that the new value does not exist in the original BST.

---
### 🧩 Example:

#### Input:
```css
	root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
```

Output:
```css
	[4,2,7,1,3,5]
```

#### Explanation:
The new tree looks like:
```css
        4
       / \
      2   7
     / \  /
    1  3 5

```
### ⚙️ Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
    
- `-10^8 <= Node.val <= 10^8`
    
- All values in the tree are **unique**.
    
- `-10^8 <= val <= 10^8`
    
- It is guaranteed that `val` does not exist in the original BST.
